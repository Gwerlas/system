  short_description: emit a real Ansible warning from a task
  description:
      - ansible-core ships no module to warn - C(debug) prints in green and
        reads as ordinary output, C(fail) stops the play. Any task result
        carrying a C(warnings) key is surfaced by the task executor as a
        genuine C([WARNING]:), which is all this action does.
      - It runs on the controller, so it ships nothing to the target and needs
        no connection.
      - Warnings are deduplicated on their exact text, so include
        C(inventory_hostname) in the message to keep one line per host.
  options:
    msg:
      description: the warning to emit
      type: str
      required: True
